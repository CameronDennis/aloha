# aloha

This program takes in Hawaiian words and converts them to English pronounciation. This was an exercise in performing array indexing, I/O, and basic loops and conditional statements. 

I do not give my permission for any of this code to be used, as it was done as a learning exercise and doing so would be plagiarism. If you would like permission to use it, message me directly.
